= Java 8 to Java 14 - Some Notable Enhancements

== Title
Notable feature changes since Java 8 until Java 14

== Abstract
This session shares notable changes in the Java ecosystem starting from Java 8 all the way until Java 14. No vendor-specific changes or enhancements are covered. 

== Description
Given the breadth of the topic and a time limit, this session will only cover the most notable or impactful changes. 

For instance, Java 9 introduced 150 new features: Java 9 changes focus on programmatic/syntactic changes for most part but will cover the new Java Module system JPMS, since it makes a huge impact for library developers.

Similar constraints apply for Java 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14. However, post-Java 9, the release cadence of 6 months has greatly reduced the number of features delivered making the content more viable to present a larger percentage of changes.
